This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Questions
1. Why did you decide on the framework choice you used as part of your solution?
    + I chose React because it is what was still fresh in my head. 

2. Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
    + I think i could have mapped out the interactions between screens a bit better. I also wanted to do more extensive testing on different devices. 

3. What would you do differently if you were given more time?
    + If I was given more time, I would work towards developing more of the backend. For example, I was able to get
    everything but the "Order Placed At" section. Instead, it is hard Coded in.
    I would also try to make it more responsive. I would also create tests for the app.


## Landing Page

I decided to go with a image background. I would like to think Bruce's is a sophisticated restaurant with fancy fonts.

## Login Page

The login page is a bit sparse and if I had more time I would design the mobile and desktop login pages a bit differently.

## Order Page

The orders page has an interesting ordering format. I wanted to figure out a way to be able to notify
a user that they made an order or chose something so I added a table that gets orders added to it 
as the user clicks on the Add To Order button. They are also able to delete orders.

## View Orders Page

The view orders page is a table where it shows what all past orders were. Its a page that assumes the 
user has finished paying and it is kind of like a receipt. I also added the delete functionality/
