This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Questions
1. Why did you decide on the framework choice you used as part of your solution?
    + I chose React because it is what was still fresh in my head. 

2. Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
    + I think i could have mapped ou the interactions between screens a bit better. I also wanted to do more extensive testing on different devices.

3. What would you do differently if you were given more time?
    + If I was given more time, I would work towards developing more of the backend. For example, I was able to get
    everything but the "Order Placed At" section. Instead, it is hard Coded in.
    I would also try to make it more responsive.


##Landing Page

I decided to go with a image background. I would like to think Bruce's is a sophisticated restaurant with fancy fonts.

##Login Page

The login page is a bit sparse and if I had more time I would design the mobile and desktop login pages a bit differently.

##Order Page

The orders page has an interesting ordering format. I think if I had more time I would have tried to flesh out the functionality a bit better.

The view orders page is a table where it shows what all past orders were.
